# **MATLAB BASICS-Week 1:**
Results of our code (with screenshots)

## 1. Basic Matrix Operations:
* Create a simple vector with 10 elements called A
* Add 3 to each element of vector A and store the result in a new vector ’B’.
* Creating a 5 x 5 matrix ’X’ using semicolons (;) to separate the rows of a matrix.
* Find the transpose of the matrix X and store the result in a new matrix ’Y’.
* Multiply these two matrices, ’X’ and ’Y’
* Multiply the corresponding elements of two matrices
* Create a column vector X1, from the elements of the 4th row of the matrix ’X’. To refer all the elements in the mth column we type X(:,m).
* Select the elements in the mth through nth columns of matrix ’X’.
* Create a sub-matrix ’X2’ taking the inner sub-part of matrix ’X’.
* Delete a Row or a Column in a Matrix ’X’.
