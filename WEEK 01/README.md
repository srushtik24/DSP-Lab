# **MATLAB BASICS-Week 1:**
Results of our code (with screenshots)

## 1. Basic Matrix Operations:
* Create a simple vector with 10 elements called A
* Add 3 to each element of vector A and store the result in a new vector ’B’.
* Creating a 5 x 5 matrix ’X’ using semicolons (;) to separate the rows of a matrix.
* Find the transpose of the matrix X and store the result in a new matrix ’Y’.
* Multiply these two matrices, ’X’ and ’Y’
* Multiply the corresponding elements of two matrices
* Create a column vector X1, from the elements of the 4th row of the matrix ’X’. To refer all the elements in the mth column we type X(:,m).
* Select the elements in the mth through nth columns of matrix ’X’.
* Create a sub-matrix ’X2’ taking the inner sub-part of matrix ’X’.
* Delete a Row or a Column in a Matrix ’X’.

## 2. MATLAB Commands: Graph, Save, and Read:
* (a) Generate elementary signals and display using plot, subplot and stem commands in MATLAB. Also add xlabel, ylabel, axis tight, grid on, legend to the figure.
* (b) save, load, xlsread, xlswrite, audioread and audiowrite commands.
    1. Create and save two variables, A and B, to a file called ABfile.mat.
ii. Create and save two variables, A and B, to a file called AB1file.txt.
iii. Create and save two variables, A and B, to a file called AB1file.xls.
iv. Create two variables, save them to an ASCII file, and then view the
contents of the file.
v. Create a structure, s1, that contains three fields, a, b, and c. Save the
fields of structure s1 as individual variables in a file called newstruct.mat.
vi. Save two variables to ’example.mat’. Then, append a third variable to
the same file.
* (d) readcell and writecell commands: (writes to a file with the name and extension specified as .txt, .dat, .xls or .csv for delimited text files)
* (e) writematrix, write a matrix to a file and readmatrix, read matrix from file: (writes to a file with the name and extension specified as .txt, .dat, .xls or .csv for delimited text files)
