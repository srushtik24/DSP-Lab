%a. while loop - repeatedly executes statements while condition is true, b. continue - loop to skip 
%the remainder of its body, c. break - terminates the loop statement

while 1 %will always return true and keep the loop running unless otherwise interrupted by us.
    n= input("Enter your favourite number: ");
    if rem(n,2)==0
        fprintf("No, don't make me read even numbers, you're out\n");
        break
    else
        fprintf("Nice, I love numbers that are not even, you get another chance \n");
        continue
    end
end

%for loop - a loop that needs to execute a specific number of times. 
%Nested Loops - for or/and while.

N= input("Enter a small number: ");
for(i= 1:N)
    fprintf("You're in outer loop number: %d\n", i);
    for(j= 1:N-3)
        fprintf("You're in inner loop number: %d\n",j);
    end
    fprintf("\n");
end
