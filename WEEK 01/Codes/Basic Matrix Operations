%BASIC MATRIX OPERATIONS:

%Create a simple vector with 10 elements called A
A=[1:10]

%Add 3 to each element of vector A and store the result in a new vector ’B’.
B= A+3

%Creating a 5 x 5 matrix ’X’ using semicolons (;) to separate the rows of a matrix.
X=[1:5;6:10;11:15;16:20;21:25]

%Find the transpose of the matrix X and store the result in a new matrix ’Y’.
Y= X'

%Multiply these two matrices, ’X’ and ’Y’
Z= Y*X

%Multiply the corresponding elements of two matrices i.e Array
%Multiplication
W= Y.*X

%Create a row vector X1, from the elements of the 4th row of the matrix
%’X’. To refer all the elements in the mth column we type X(:,m).
X1=X(4,:)

%Select the elements in the mth through nth columns of matrix ’X’. Here:
%2nd to 4th column
X2= X(:,2:end-1)

%Create a sub-matrix ’X2’ taking the inner sub-part of matrix ’X’.
X3=X(2:4, 2:4)

%Delete a Row or a Column in a Matrix ’X’. Here: 2nd row
X(2,:)=[]
