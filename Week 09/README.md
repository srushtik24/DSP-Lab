# **WEEK -09: IIR Filter Design Using Pole-Zero Placement Method:**

## Aim: 
In this experiment, we design lowpass, highpass, bandpass and bandpass filters using the pole-zero placement method. For the each of the filter specifications, 
*•	Find the transfer function 
*•	Sketch the magnitude and phase responses and pole-zero plot 
*•	Obtain the difference equation for each of the filtering system 
*•	Obtain the output of each of the IIR filter systems for the input ECG and PPG signals sampled at rate of 360 Hz. [Verify MATLAB Implementation]
