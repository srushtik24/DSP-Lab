# **WEEK -02: MOVING AVERAGE FILTER AND DERIVATIVE BASED OPERATORS:**

## MOVING AVERAGE FILTER:
1. The moving average filter is a simple Low Pass FIR (Finite Impulse Response) filter commonly used for smoothing an array of sampled data/ signal. 
2. It takes M samples of input at a time and takes the average of those M-samples and produces a single output point. As the filter length increases (the parameter M) the smoothness of the output increases, whereas the sharp transitions in the data are made increasingly blunt. 
3. This implies that this filter has excellent time domain response but a poor frequency response.
